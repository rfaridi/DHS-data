# 28th June, 2020

Let's first load the libraries 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
```


```{r}
fac17 <- read_dta("./rawdata/dhs_facility_spa_2017.dta")
```

Let's have a look at the data

```{r}
dim(fac17)
```

Too many variables, let's just have a look at some of the few.

```{r}
head(names(fac17))
```

It's time to get hold of the questionnaire
